## App Dependancies

To install the dependancies of the app you have to turn the directory to neither the FrontEnd folder or the BackEnd folder 

- for FrontEnd
  `cd udagram/udagram-frontend`
  then
  `npm install -f`

- for BackEnd
   `cd udagram/udagram-api` 
   then
   `npm install`  

  ### note: the sequelize and @types/sequelize versions are installed manually.
